SUMMARY = """
    The second half of the 15th century was a turning point in the life of Rome and Catholicism as a whole.
    Rodrigo Borgia, first thanks to family connections, then using his cunning mind and diplomatic skills, 
    managed to obtain the title of Pope. The man began to rule the possessions entrusted to him with an iron fist.
    Those who were dissatisfied and openly opposed him could be subjected to persecution and painful execution,
    and their property would go to the religious leader. Behind-the-scenes struggles were no less effective than open negotiations and business visits. 
    The threat from the French monarchs, who wanted to obtain hereditary lands, was met with a worthy response from the hero. 
    Numerous advantageous alliances and influential acquaintances invariably helped him turn the situation to his advantage.
    The new Pope also became famous as a very dissolute man who loved fornication and illicit relationships.He had several sons, 
    each of whom received enough privileges to rise in status. Cesare achieved the most impressive successes, 
    leading the army in effective maneuvers and operations. Rodrigo's insatiability knew no bounds; even in his old age, 
    he continued to expand his possessions, weaving intrigues and conspiracies.
